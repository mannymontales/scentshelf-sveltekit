# Stage 1: Build the app
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json 
COPY package*.json .

# Install dependencies, including dotenv based on package.json
RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of your app's source code from your host to your image filesystem.
COPY . .

# We run the npm run build command so that SvelteKit generates the build directory, 
# containing a standalone Node server that serves our application â€” assuming, of course, that you're using adapter-node.
# We subsequently run the npm prune --production command to delete all the dev dependencies from the "node_modules" folder, since we no longer need any of them.
RUN npm run build
RUN npm prune --production

# Stage 2
